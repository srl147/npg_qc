=head1 NAME

npg_qc::autoqc::results::base

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A composition-based parent object for autoqc result objects.

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 BUILD

Default object constructor extension that is called after the object is created,
but before it is returned to the caller. Builds the composition accessor.

=head2 composition

A npg_tracking::glossary::composition object. If the derived
class inplements id_run and position methods/attributes, a one-component
composition is created automatically.

=head2 result_file_path

An optional attribute, a full path of the file with JSON serialization.
Not expected to be assigned at the time of analysis, does not have to be
saved to a database. Might be assigned by the application that loads the
file-based serialized results into memory in order to cache the file path
for possible subsequent reading by a different application.
